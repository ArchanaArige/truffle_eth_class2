# Truffle-Init-Webpack Project

Truffle Webpack has received so many updates over the months that I have opted to completely remove this directory. You can install it easily by hand and receive the latest updates!

Install truffle webpack by:

1. `npm install -g truffle` if you have no truffle yet
2. `truffle unbox webpack`

The Webpack box has changed since we recorded the video. Instead of directly running "npm run dev" you need to first `cd app && npm run dev`.
